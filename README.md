# Grad Ball Receipt Automator (Printed Version)

This version is for the DIGITAL version, where one receipt is in one page. This is meant to be integrated with another script that automatically splits the document into pages and EMAILS it automatically.

*Modified from the previous version*

## What and Why



Last April 2023, as our school's Pupil Council Treasurer, I was tasked with creating receipts for our upcoming Grad Ball. I created a template for the receipts via a Word Document. To do this manually, I'd have to type down each name in each receipt twice (since there are two copies), then type down the class number twice, then create a random receipt ID to be inputted. I estimated that this would take me around 30 seconds per receipt! There were around 80 attendees, so that would take me literally **40 minutes**, at the least!


So, with the help of trusty ChatGPT and tons of time spent debugging, I created a python program that automatically parses through a list of names and their assigned section, creates a receipt ID and inputs it in each receipt! It took a while to make this work, but when it did, it was really satisfying. Saved me tons of manual work!


_Anyway, I just randomly had a thought to deploy this to GitHub â€” maybe someone might get inspiration from this or whatnot, but yeah, hope you enjoy this program :)_

### 2. Setting Up

- Navigate to the folder and edit the text file```names.txt``` and replace the sample names, copy pasting a list you have of the names/attendees of those people who you want to generate a Grad Ball Receipt for. Edit ```class_section.txt```, replacing it with the section of each attendee listed in the names.txt file (in order).

- Next, open the file ```Final_GradBall Layout.docx``` in a word processing software such as Microsoft Word and duplicate the content, adding a new page for every attendee. For example, if you have 50 attendees, then duplicate the content by copy and pasting until you have 50 pages. This will probably only take a maximum of 3-4 minutes (simply just Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V) / Or even less than 30 seconds, if you're really fast at copy pasting just like me :)

***Make sure you save the file.***





> [!NOTE]  
> You have to ensure that your amount of attendees that you listed in the names.txt file is equal to the number of pages. For example, if a total of 50 attendees so there has to be 50 pages. If there are more pages with content than the number of attendees, Python will give out an error.

### 3. Open the Terminal application on your Mac and run the program!



- Install python-docx library

```
pip3 install python-docx
```



- Navigate to the downloaded folder

```
cd /directorywherethefolderyoudownloadedis
```

For me, it's 
```
cd /users/david/Downloads/spelling-bee-mac-master
```

- Then, run the program using the command 
```
python3 automate.py
```




- If the program finished running successfully, you'll see a document in your folder called ```Modified_Document.docx```.

 Open it and you'll see each attendee with 2 Grad Ball Receipts with a specific class section and Receipt ID
